"Bank Account" was a lab that I had completed on June 24th, 2024 for my Intermediate Programming course. This project utilized C++ classes and file handling to simulate a basic banking system. This project involved creating a BankAccount class with several methods to manage account balances and interest rates. The class included setter functions to set the balance and interest rate, either with a full dollar and cents amount or just the dollar amount. It also featured an update function that calculates the interest earned after one year and adjusts the balance accordingly. To enhance usability, the program outputs the balance and interest rate to the console, and it also saves this information to a text file for further reference. The program also includes a helper function to convert interest rates into fractions for accurate calculations. The project was structured around efficient file I/O, ensuring that data could be saved or retrieved seamlessly. The associated header file provides the necessary class definition and function declarations for the BankAccount class, enabling smooth interaction between the cpp file and the user interface.
